                <h1>Band Info</h1>
            <p>Death Grips is an American experimental hip hop group formed in 2010 in Sacramento, California. The group consists of producers Zach Hill (drums) and Andy Morin (keyboards), and vocalist Stefan Burnett, also known as MC Ride. Though he is not the group's frontman, Hill has been credited with being the driving creative force behind the project. Drawing from punk rock, electronic, noise, and industrial styles, the band's innovative and often difficult-to-categorize sound has earned critical acclaim and a cult following, while their aggressive performance style and cryptic interactions with their fans and the media have gained widespread notoriety.</p>

            <h1>About this song</h1>
            <p>Description: This is the first version of Hacker. Originally, it was made for their mixtape
                <a href="https://soundcloud.com/deathgrips/sets/death-grips-exmilitary" target="_blank">(Ex-Military)</a> on SoundCloud since it's not available on Spotify or Apple Music. However, it later ended up on the 2012 classic album <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-money-store/515449028" target="_blank">The Money Store</a> because the band felt it didn't fit on the mixtape. You can also listen on<a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/1PQDjdBpHPikAodJqjzm6a" target="_blank"> Spotify</a> or <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-money-store/515449028" target="_blank"> Apple Music</a>.</p>
